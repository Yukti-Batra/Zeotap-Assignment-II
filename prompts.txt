Prompts Used During Development (via Microsoft Copilot):

1. Write a method to connect to ClickHouse with JWT token authentication.
2. Implement schema discovery logic for a specific ClickHouse database.
3. Generate a REST API for exporting data from a ClickHouse table into a Flat File (CSV).
4. Create a method to parse a Flat File and insert its data into a ClickHouse table.
5. Develop a frontend HTML file with:
   - A dropdown for source/target selection.
   - Input fields for ClickHouse connection parameters.
   - Column selection controls (checkboxes).
   - Buttons for actions like "Connect", "Load Columns", "Preview", and "Start Ingestion."
6. Write the integration logic between the frontend (HTML/JS) and backend APIs using Fetch API.
7. Document a comprehensive `README.md` for the project, including setup, configuration, and run instructions.
8. Provide a step-by-step guide for testing the APIs with example datasets.
9. Guide on how to structure the deliverables for submission (source code, prompts.txt, README, and demo video).
10. Create test cases for:
    - ClickHouse to Flat File ingestion.
    - Flat File to ClickHouse ingestion.
    - Multi-table JOIN queries.
    - Connection/authentication failure scenarios.
11. Generate a sample `index.html` file that includes the UI requirements and interactions for the tool.
12. Provide error handling strategies for connection/authentication failures and file parsing errors.
